If you're just starting with frontend development, you've likely come across a file named index.html. You might wonder what it is if you donâ€™t have prior knowledge. Think of HTML as the skeleton of any website. It provides the basic structure and layout, determining how different elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links are organized on a webpage. Without HTML, web pages would have no form or structure to build upon.
