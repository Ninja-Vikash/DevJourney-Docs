**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code during software development.<br/>
Created by _Linus Torvalds_ in 2005, it helps manage project history, collaborate with others, and roll back to previous versions if needed.<br/>
Git stores data as snapshots of the entire project, unlike traditional systems that track file-by-file changes.

### Key feature of Git

- **Branching**<br/>Developers can create branches to experiment with changes without affecting the main codebase.
- **Merging**<br/>Combines changes from different branches or developers.
- **Commit history**<br/>Records snapshots of changes, enabling easy tracking of project progress.
- **Collaboration**<br/>.Supports teamwork by allowing multiple contributors to work on the same project from different locations.
