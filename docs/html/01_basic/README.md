## Docs.dev - HTML introduction

*I am going to tell you a HACK!* ðŸ˜Ž

You can use `shift` + `!` to generate HTML boiler plate in VS Code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
> The above block known as boiler plate


`<html lang="en">` , lang attribute used to define language ( eg: "en" )<br />
`<head>` , contains all `<meta>` tags, `<title>`, internal `<style>` and external stylesheets `<link>`<br/>
`<body>` , where you are going to spend your lot time to build layouts.

`<body>` tag is the display, which appears on the browser's screen.

**Wait**<br/>
