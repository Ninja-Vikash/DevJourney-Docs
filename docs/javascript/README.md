JavaScript is a programming language that brings web pages to life.<br/>
It's the core technology of the web, working alongside HTML and CSS.<br/>
While HTML structures the content and CSS styles it. JavaScript adds *interactivity* and *dynamic behaviour*.

***

### What can we do with JavaScript ?
- **Create interactive elements**: `button`s, `menu`s, `slider`s, etc.
- **Animate graphics and images**: Create engaging visual effects.
- **Update content dynamically**: Load new data without reloading the page.
- **Build web applications**: Complex applications like online stores, social media platforms.
- **Develop server side applications**: Using Node.js, you can create backend systems.

### Key characterstics of JavaScript
- **Lightweight and Interpreted**: It runs directly in the browser without needing compilation.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on different operating systems and browsers.
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports object-based programming for code organization.
- **Dynamically types**: You don't need to specify data types beforehand.

## History of JavaScript

### Birth of JavaScript
- **1995**<br/>*Brenden Eich*, a programmer at **Netscape Communication**, created JavaScript in a mere 10 days. Initially named **Mocha**, it was later renamed **LiveScript** and finally **JavaScript** to capitalize on the popularity of **Java** at the time.

- **Purpose**<br/>Designed to add interactivity to static HTML pages, JavaScript brought life to the web.

### Early years and Browser's war
- **1996 - 1997**<br/>JavaScript gained rapid adoption with **Netscape Navigator** and **Internet Explorer** becoming the dominant browsers.

- **Browser wars**<br/>Intense competiton between **Netscape** and **Microsoft** led to different JavaScript implementations, causing compatiblity issues.

- **ECMAScript**<br/>To standardize the language, *ECMA International* created **ECMAScript**, a specification for JavaScript.

### Growth and Maturity
- **1997 - 2000**<br/>The Document Object Model ( **DOM** ) and Dynamic HTML ( **DHTML** ) emerged, expanding JavaScript capablities.

- **2006 - 2010**<br/>**jquery** and other libraries simplified JavaScript development and popularized its use.

- **2009 - 2015**<br/>ECMAScript 5 and 6 introduced significant improvements, making JavaScript a more robust language.

### Modern JavaScript
- **2015 onwards**<br/>JavaScript has evolved rapidly, becoming a full-fledge language for building complex applications.

- **Node.js**<br/>Revolutionized server-side development with JavaScript, enabling full stack development.

- **Frameworks and Libraries**<br/>React, Angular, Vue, and others emerged, providing powerful tools for building user interfaces.

## Creation of server-side JavaScript
while JavaScript initially designed for the client-side, its versatility and popularity led to its expansion into server-side development.

### Early attempts
- **Before Node.js**<br/>Several attempts were made to run JavaScript on the server, but they lacked widespread adoption.

- **Challenges**<br/>Performance, scalablity, and ecosystem limitations hindered these early efforts.

### The rise of Node.js
- **2009**<br/>*Ryan Dahl* released Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on chrome's V8 Javascript engine.

- **Event-driven architecture**<br/>Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven approach made it highly efficient for handling concurrent connections.

- **Package ecosystem** ( **npm** )<br/>A vast collection of reusable modules accelerated development.

- **Full-Stack JavaScript**<br/>Developers could now use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development.
