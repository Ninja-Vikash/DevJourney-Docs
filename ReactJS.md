### Caveats
It follows : **Write Once use Everywhere** principle. and **DRY** (Don't repeat yourself) Principle.

One of the best thing of react is, react is bareboned.
We don't need to understand all the concepts of react.
Infact if we know only programming in Javascript then it will become more familiar with us.

Even react don't have ROUTER - Without loading page we can move to the next page.

    ```
     code .
    ```
    > You can skip this if you are not going to open VS code.
3. In terminal [Desktop or VS code]
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest
    ```
    Now answer the following questions-

    - project name : `<project-name>`
    > If you give any name it will create another folder and deploy all the essentials inside it.

    So, project name : `.`
    > It will deploy all the essential in the current directory.
